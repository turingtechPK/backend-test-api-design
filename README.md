# TuringTech Technical Test / Backend API (Beginner -> Intermediate)

to access the api use the following url

{{backendURL}}/github_api/newContributors/{{org}}/{{repo}}/
{{backendURL}}/github_api/newContributors/{{org}}/{{repo}}/year
{{backendURL}}/github_api/newContributors/{{org}}/{{repo}}/year/month
backendURL currently is localhost:3000

eg: http://localhost:3000/github_api/newContributors/airbnb/HorizonCalendar 
gave response :

{
    "org": "airbnb",
    "repository": "HorizonCalendar",
    "year": 1970,
    "month": 1,
    "newContributors": 7
}


SOLUTION APPROACH USED:

This problem can be divided into five steps

1. Start the server and successfully fetch data from any github api
2. Find/Identify the API/s that cater the requirements
3. Save the data into mongoDB
4. process the data to get the required result 
5. cater all the cases required other than sending the data (error handling etc)

1... for step 1 currently using https to fetch the api data
1... to reduce the complexity and cost of making the api call of commits, will use mongoDb to store some data for future reference.

2.3.4.. using 2 apis to get the data.. saving the data in mongoDb to prevent redundant resource utilization for looping the commits.

5... sub steps needed for task 5:
1: get all contributors -- loop through all pages of contributors 
2: get data from db
3: check of contributors are same as that in DB
3.1: if same ... move to step 6
3.2: if not same move to step 4
4: call commits api with start data fetched from Db -- loop through all pages of contributors 
5. loop through commits to find first commit of user
6. calculate count and send response
