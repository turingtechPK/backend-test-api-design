# TuringTech Technical Test / Backend API (Beginner -> Intermediate)

The goal of this test is to evaluate your ability:
- to architecture a simple but reliable backend application,
- to process data and compute metrics,
- and to build a JSON API delivering these metrics.

## Instructions

For an organisation of your choice on GitHub (that has public repositories like Airbnb https://github.com/airbnb) , you need to build an app that computes the number of monthly new contributors for each of those repositories, from the month of their creation until now.

A new contributor is someone who did a commit for the first time in a repository.

### Homework
Build a **straightforward** application able to fetch data from GitHub API in a reliable and efficient way. You'll need to handle GitHub API errors and rate limit so that calls are retried properly.

Store the fetched data in a storage system of your choice (in-memory, filesystem, database, ...) and expose a HTTP JSON API delivering the results. The format of the API is the following (example with Facebook):

```json
//GET /facebook/react/2019
{
    "org": "Facebook",
    "repository": "react", 
    "year": "2019",
    "newContributors": ...,
}

//GET /facebook/jest/2018
{
    "org": "Facebook",
    "repository": "jest", 
    "year": "2018",
    "newContributors": ...,
}
```

```json
//GET /facebook/react/2019/06
{
    "org": "Facebook",
    "repository": "react",
    "year": "2019",
    "month": "06",
    "newContributors": ...,
}

//GET /facebook/jest/2018/03
{
    "org": "Facebook",
    "repository": "jest",
    "year": "2018",
    "month": "03",
    "newContributors": ...,
}
```
You can access the GitHub API using your personal GitHub account. There are many ways to retrieve the needed data, choose the most simple one, you do not need to handle more than what is required for the app.

### Evaluation Criteria

- NodeÂ best practices
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?
- Documentation: is the API well-documented?

### Bonus

- Use typescript
- Use NestJS or any other node.js framework like Express/Fastify

### Code Submit

### Questions
Please remember that the test has all the information you need to complete it, in case of confusion just make an assumption and move forward with your work.

All the best and happy coding.
